// Deciding what this window shows: a backend it starts, or one that is already serving.
//
// TWO MODES, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS OWNERSHIP. In `own` mode the shell starts a harness
// process against a state root and is responsible for stopping it. In `attach` mode it
// starts nothing, stops nothing, and renders a backend somebody else is running. The
// modes are resolved here so that main.mjs cannot accidentally do half of each, and so
// that a shell told to attach NEVER falls back to starting something — a fallback would
// put a second writer on somebody else's data and call it a recovery.
//
// WHY THE SHELL NEEDS A CHECKOUT AT ALL. `scripts/launch-dsh.py` verifies the
// release's artifact record against the tracked bytes of the checkout it runs
// from, so a checkout at any other commit fails the check. Rather than ask a
// person to keep two paths in their head, the shell reads the commit the release
// records about itself and prepares a private checkout pinned to exactly that.
//
// Everything here is a default that config or the environment overrides, and
// none of it touches a deployment, a release or the user's own working tree.
