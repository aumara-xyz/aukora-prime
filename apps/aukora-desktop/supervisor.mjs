//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The harness mints one random launch token per process and
// writes it only to the private server log of the state root it was given. A shell
// that wants to show the app must therefore own that state root: it creates the
// directories at mode 0700, spawns the launcher against them, and reads the token
// out of a log no other party can read. The token never travels through a shared
// log, an argument list, an environment variable or the clipboard.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO. It never touches a state root it did not create, it
// never kills a listener it did not spawn, and it never edits a release. The only
// process it will stop is the pid it started in this session.

 * Stop only the process we started, and WAIT for it to be gone.

 *
 * WHY THIS BLOCKS. Its caller is `app.on('will-quit')`, which cannot await anything — the handler
 * returns and Electron quits. Sending SIGTERM and exiting immediately is what produced the port
 * race twice: the backend needs a moment to close its listening socket, and the person reopening
 * AUKORA arrives inside that moment. So the wait is synchronous and bounded, and the ceiling is
 * short enough that a stubborn child delays the quit rather than hanging it. The listening socket
 * belongs to the child, so its exit IS the port closing; the launch side waits for the port itself
 * as well, which covers anything else that might still hold it. The pid the launcher records is the
 * LAUNCHER'S OWN child — the launcher exits and the backend is reparented — so its going is observed
 * as the pid disappearing. A pid that were this process's direct child would linger as a zombie that
 * `kill(pid, 0)` still reports, which is why the court's fixture spawns its quitter detached.
 *
 * NOTHING IS ESCALATED. This never sends SIGKILL: the child is closing databases, and a hard kill
 * would trade a slow quit for a corrupt one. A child that ignores SIGTERM past the ceiling is left
 * running, and the next launch says `port-unavailable` naming the port — the honest report.
 * @param {number} pid - the pid this shell spawned.

 * THE GRACEFUL-RESTART WATCHDOG (Fable, alpha-17 item 1; deadline: the next OOM, due ≈18:50).
 *
 * THE FAILURE IT EXISTS FOR, MEASURED 2026-09-27 16:22: the live backend died with
 * `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory` after 8,222,171 ms (2.28 h
 * under seven-lane load), Mark-Compact at 4048 MB — V8's DEFAULT old-space cap, so it dies the moment it arrives.
 * This restarts the backend BEFORE that, at a quiet moment, and relies on goal-resume to re-arm the lanes.
 *
 * THE FOOTPRINT COMES FROM footprint(1), NOT ps. Resident size misses what a JS heap holds; `phys_footprint` is what
 * the crash actually reports, and the same reader the rest of this lane already validated against real output.
 *
 * **IT DECIDES FROM INJECTED SOURCES OF TRUTH, AND IT FAILS CLOSED WHEN A SOURCE DOES NOT EXIST.** "Never
 * mid-approval" is absolute, so it is NOT inferred from a log: MEASURED, the live state root has
 * `state/logs/aukora-signer.log` and NO `aukora-approval-events.log` at all, so a reader over that file would report
 * "no approval open" from a file that has never existed — the fail-open shape this lane refuses. Absent an
 * `approvalOpen` predicate the watchdog says `approval-state-unknown` once and restarts NOTHING.
 *
 * The stop/start pair is the caller's, so the ORDER is provable: stop the backend it was told to stop, wait, then
 * start. The restart line is written BEFORE the stop, so a restart that dies half-way is still recorded as attempted.
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {() => Promise<number|null>} o.pidOf   the live backend pid, from the launch record.
 * @param {(pid: number) => Promise<void>} o.stop  graceful stop of that pid (SIGTERM + wait).
 * @param {() => Promise<object>} o.start          start a fresh backend.
 * @param {() => boolean|Promise<boolean>} [o.approvalOpen]  true while someone is being asked to approve.
 * @param {() => number|null|Promise<number|null>} [o.lastTurnAt]  epoch ms of the last lane turn START, if visible.

/**
 * HOW THE SWAP ARMS THIS, AND WHY IT IS NOT ARMED HERE.
 *
 * `startRestartWatchdog` decides and acts only when a caller supplies the sources of truth, and nothing in the checkout
 * calls it yet. That is deliberate: arming it needs TWO things this module cannot invent, and a wrong one would restart
 * the running app at the wrong moment.
 *
 *   1. AN APPROVAL SOURCE. `aumlok-bridge.mjs` publishes `isDrawPending: () => draw.isPending()` (`:1458`), which is the
 *      shell's own answer to "is a person being asked to approve right now". MEASURED: the approval EVENT log does not
 *      exist in the live state root (`state/logs/aukora-signer.log` exists, `aukora-approval-events.log` does not), so a
 *      reader over that file would report "no approval open" from a file that has never existed. Without a predicate the
 *      watchdog logs `approval-state-unknown` and restarts NOTHING, which is the correct failure but not a guard.
 *
 *   2. A CALLABLE BOOT. `ownedPid` is set inside main.mjs's single startup block and the harness start is not a named
 *      function, so `start` cannot be wired without extracting that block. Two shapes work, and the choice is a product
 *      decision rather than a technical one:
 *        (a) extract the startup block into `async function bootBackend()` and pass it as `start`, keeping the window;
 *        (b) pass `async () => { stopSpawned(ownedPid); app.relaunch(); app.exit(0) }`, which restarts the whole shell —
 *            honest and one line, but it closes the person's window, so it is Fable's and Peter's call, not mine.
 *
 * The court asserts the INGREDIENTS exist (the bridge's published getter, `spawnedPid`, `stopSpawned`), so a swap that
 * follows this recipe fails loudly if one of them disappears rather than silently doing nothing.
