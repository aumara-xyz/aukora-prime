// The shell's half of AUMLOK in the app: the public state, the one-bit approval question, and the
// receipt. THIS FILE NO LONGER OPENS A CEREMONY WINDOW AND NO LONGER RUNS A CEREMONY.
//
// THE CEREMONY IS THE AUMLOK SCREEN INSIDE THE FACE, NOT A SEPARATE WINDOW. v2 opened a second
// BrowserWindow from three sites in this file — an opener, a mode whitelist and a page loaded from
// `aumlok-ceremony.html` — and that window, its page and its preload are gone. Binding now happens
// where the person already is: the app GENERATES seven words from real entropy, shows them ONCE on
// the Aumlok screen, and the person types them back. THE SAME SEVEN WORDS DERIVE THE SAME ROOT ON ANY
// MACHINE, and that IS the recovery. THE WINDOW IS NOT MERELY CLOSED, IT IS ABSENT: no second window
// and no session to open first — so there is nothing here that could open one.
//
// NO PHRASE ENTERS THIS FILE AT ALL. That is the strengthening, not a loss: v2 had to defend an IPC
// channel that received the phrase once, inward, and this process existed partly to keep that channel
// safe. A screen that renders its own words and reads its own typing hands the phrase to nothing but
// its own derivation. The shell carries the PUBLIC facts and one bit, and no more.
//
// WHY THE SHELL CARRIES THE APPROVAL AT ALL. An approval is the one thing this development cannot
// delegate to a page: it must be a modal that cannot be scrolled past, over the exact bytes, before a
// key signs them. `ask()` is that job, and it is deliberately the ONLY thing here that opens a window.
// Its answer is one bit, matched to its question by the challenge it echoes.
//
// WHY IT LOOKS INSIDE THE RELEASE AND NOT AT THIS CHECKOUT. The organ is loaded from the release the
// shell is serving (`plugins/aukora-aumlok/lib/**`), not from this tree and not from a copy — because
// two copies of a key-derivation path are two paths that can disagree. If the release does not carry
// it, the answer is a refusal BY NAME rather than a fallback that would derive a different root.
// THE OWNER DAEMON'S DETECTOR, imported rather than re-implemented: whether a daemon is installed and
// reachable is answered in ONE place, and the shell asks that place.
