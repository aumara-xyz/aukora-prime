/**
 * cite-service.mjs — READ-ONLY citation of one settled record, with its Aura position CHECKED.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. AUMA is wiring a Kira lens so the organism can say *"that is Aura sequence N"* when
 * it remembers something. **A citation that has not been checked is a sentence she cannot honestly
 * say.** The store already returns a citation carrying `auraSequence` and `verifiedHead` on every read
 * — but a value the store hands you is a POINTER, and pointing is not verifying. This module answers
 * one question: *is the chain actually intact up to the position this record claims?*
 *
 * WHAT IT REUSES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO REUSE. It uses `createMemoryOwner`'s read owner for the
 * snapshot and its `verifyChain()` for the re-derivation — the chain's own check, in the chain's own
 * module (`memory-owner.mjs`), never restated here. **It imports no stage and no settle code**: citing
 * must be impossible to turn into writing, and the cheapest way to guarantee that is for the writing
 * modules never to be in scope.
 *
 * INVARIANT 4 — UNVERIFIED IS NOT EMPTY. Three outcomes, kept apart on purpose:
 *   VERIFIED    the chain re-derived, the record sits at the position it cites, and the head returned
 *               is the head the WALK produced.
 *   UNVERIFIED  a named reason, and NO HEAD. A reader told "unverified" and handed a head anyway has
 *               been handed the thing the verdict was withholding.
 *   (refusal)   an unknown record id is refused BY NAME rather than reported as UNVERIFIED, because
 *               "this store has no such record" and "this store cannot vouch for it" are different
 *               facts and collapsing them would hide a typo behind a doubt.
