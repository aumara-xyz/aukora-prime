/**
 * THE STRICT READ AND DURABLE WRITE BOUNDARY — LIFTED, NOT REINVENTED.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Kimi's AUKORA-37 R8/R9 review found that this repository's JSON reads and writes can
 * disagree with themselves: `JSON.parse` keeps the LAST of two identical keys, so a document that SHOWS one
 * value to a reader can SETTLE another; a read that follows a symlink reads bytes the check did not see; a FIFO
 * in a slot hangs the reader; a write that is not fsynced or not atomic leaves a file that is empty, torn, or
 * truncated after a kill — and a torn tail then throws a raw `SyntaxError` that names nothing. Each of those is
 * a hole with a name here.
 *
 * EVERY FUNCTION IS LIFTED FROM CODE THAT ALREADY EXISTS IN THIS REPOSITORY, DELIBERATELY:
 *   · `readJsonStrict` — the pattern from `public-evidence.mjs`'s parse path, including its depth-aware
 *     DUPLICATE-KEY SCANNER (`assertNoDuplicateKeys`), which walks the text with a stack rather than trusting
 *     `JSON.parse`.
 *   · `durableWrite` — `journal.mjs`'s write-temp-then-rename pattern.
 *   · `exclusiveCreate` — `journal.mjs`'s create-if-absent pattern (temp, fsync, LINK, and the loser reads what
 *     the winner wrote).
 *   · `writeAllSync` and `syncDirectory` — lifted from `boundary.mjs`, because the daemon imports FROM Kira and
 *     Kira must not import from the daemon: the dependency runs one way, so the primitives come with them.
 *
 * `writeAllSync` CARRIES ITS OWN HARD-WON RULE, kept verbatim in spirit: it REFUSES anything that is not a
 * string, Buffer or Uint8Array rather than coercing it. The version that did `Buffer.from(String(contents))`
 * turned a wrong argument into fifteen bytes of `"[object Object]"` — a silent garbage write where `writeSync`
 * would have raised. A durability helper that accepts anything is a durability helper that writes anything.
 *
 * THE REFUSALS ARE NAMED, AND THAT IS THE POINT: `json:duplicate-key`, `json:malformed` (including a `RangeError`
 * from nesting too deep) and `artifact:nonregular-file`. **ENOENT PASSES THROUGH UNTOUCHED**, because a missing
 * file is an ordinary answer that callers already handle; turning it into a refusal here would break every
 * caller's first-run path.

/**
 * APPEND ONE JOURNAL LINE, FSYNCED BEFORE THE CALLER IS TOLD IT LANDED. (Design §3.6: the journal is "append-only,
 * hash-chained and fsynced on every append".)
 *
 * WHY THE APPEND LIVES HERE rather than in the journal module: this file is the plugin's ONE audited I/O boundary
 * (Fable's ruling A), and a second module that could open the store for writing would be a second door onto it. The
 * journal module keeps what is pure — the entry shape, the chain, the reading of a damaged tail — and this keeps the
 * file descriptor.
 *
 * ONE LINE AT A TIME, AND NO NEWLINE IN THE LINE: a caller that could pass two lines could write an entry no reader
 * would verify, and a torn append is a state the design names rather than a state this function may create.
 *
 * @param {{file: string, line: string}} input
 * @returns {true} after fsync has returned — the promise is that a line reported appended survives a kill.

 * List the `.json` files in a directory INSIDE the boundary — the one place allowed to reach the filesystem.

 * *"the plugin reached outside its boundary: memory-deps.mjs: imports node:fs; memory-deps.mjs: imports node:path"*. The
 * dependency builder needed a directory listing and reached for `node:fs` itself, which is exactly the widening the boundary
 * exists to refuse — and it was refused by a court rather than by a reviewer, which is the point of having one.
 *
 * ABSENT IS NOT AN ERROR: a store that was never created has no files, and the caller distinguishes that from unreadable
 * itself, because "no memories" and "cannot read your memories" must never look the same to a client.
 * @param {string} dir - an absolute directory path.
 * @returns {string[]} the `.json` file names, sorted; `[]` when the directory does not exist.
 * @throws {StrictReadRefusal} when the directory exists and cannot be read.

/**
 * Does this path exist? — asked INSIDE the boundary, so a module that may not import `node:fs` can still ask.
 *
 * Added for `memory-deps.mjs`, which must distinguish "the store was never created" (a true empty memory) from "the state
 * home does not exist" (a misconfiguration that must refuse). The distinction is the whole point of Fable's item (2).
 * @param {string} path - an absolute path.

 */
/**
 * The non-empty lines of a file INSIDE the boundary, or `[]` when it does not exist.
 *
 * Added for the remembered tier: a receipt is the sha256 of the exact canonical event LINE, and the Aura chain is a file of
 * lines, so both need lines rather than parsed objects. `readJsonStrict` cannot serve either — one line of `aura.jsonl` is not
 * a document to parse, it is a line to hash and to append after.

 *   5. DECODE WITH `TextDecoder(fatal: true)` — invalid UTF-8 refuses instead of becoming U+FFFD, which is a
 *      lossy decode that makes two different byte strings read as one.
 *   6. `JSON.parse`, with `RangeError` folded into `json:malformed` — 10k-deep nesting is a malformed document,
