/**
 * WHAT AUMA RECEIVES BEFORE SHE REPLIES — and what she must never be told. (Design §4, revision 2.)
 *
 * THE FRAME IS DATA, NOT ORDERS. Every line carries the tier it came from and the handle a citation refers to, so the
 * app's Sources chip can list exactly what was in the request bytes. §4.1-§4.3 fix the shape, the filters, the budgets
 * and the words, and this module implements them as one pure function of the notes it is given.
 *
 * THE TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO GET WRONG, AND ARE THEREFORE EXPLICIT HERE:
 *   · A REMEMBERED CITATION IS "intact", NEVER "verified" (§4.3). "Verified" is a word this engine uses internally
 *     about a digest; it is not a word Auma may say about a note, because the note is unsigned and nobody checked it.
 *   · AN INSTRUCTION CATEGORY NOTE IS NEVER IN PRE-TURN RECALL (§4.1). An instruction is the one shape that can read as
 *     an order, and instruction notes appear only in a deliberate lookup, and there as "Peter mentioned possibly wanting
 *     a rule about X (not in effect)".
 *
 * NOTHING HERE READS THE STORE. The ranker's scores, the verification answers and the session's handle map all arrive as
 * arguments, so a court drives every budget, every filter and every escaping rule directly.
 *
 * @module @aukora/dsh-plugin-kira/memory-frame
