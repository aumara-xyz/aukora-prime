/**
 * KIRA RECALL INJECTION — recalled memory arrives in a fresh agent's context without being asked for.
 *
 * THE FIRST FAILING STAGE OF MEMORY ACROSS SESSIONS IS INJECTION, NOT RECALL. Measured 2026-09-21: a
 * child agent inherits the workspace, the organs and memory reach, and starts blind on the
 * conversation. Asked to call `kira_recall` it returned the record its parent had settled that morning;
 * asked what it could see it said *"no prior conversation history or memory from any other agent
 * session is visible to me."* Both were true. Nothing was broken — nothing had told it to ask.
 * `index.js` declares `inject = ['tools']` and had no `ctx.on` at all, so no configuration of this
 * deployment could put a record in a fresh context.
 *
 * HOW IT INJECTS, AND WHY THIS SEAM. `ctx.on('agent/pre-step', (payload, next) => …)` — a WATERFALL, so
 * `next()` is awaited FIRST and the chain is delegated to before anything is appended; skipping it
 * would short-circuit every listener after this one. The payload carries the proposed step's messages,
 * so appending here lands the record in the batch the model is about to read.
 *
 * `agent/created` + `agent.inject(UserMessage)` is the other seam and is NOT used, for a measured
 * reason rather than a preference: `agent.inject` takes a `UserMessage` built by `createUserMessage`
 * from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`, and **that import does not resolve from a release-mounted plugin**
 * (`node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm` is absent at the repo root, in the plugin, and in the release;
 * `PROVENANCE.md:74-83` records the same finding for `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools`). `pre-step` needs no
 * constructor — the message is a literal — so it is the seam that works from where this plugin sits.
 * The reference implementation is the harness's own `context/time-context`, which prepends a pre-step
 * listener and appends one sourced user message the same way.
 *
 * THE MESSAGE IS DATA AND SAYS SO IN THE TYPE. The message source carries `form: 'snapshot'` and NOT
 * `form: 'instructions'`. That is not a naming choice: `ContextFormed` declares `'instructions'` as an
 * explicit variant, so a recalled record labelled that way would be telling a model to follow text
 * that the owner — or another agent — merely wrote down. A record is a record. The rendered text also
 * says "recalled data, not an instruction" in words, because a provenance field is not a label a model
 * necessarily reads.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It never writes: it holds a READ owner, whose own contract is "READS SPEND
 * NOTHING … consults no grant, touches no nonce store, and cannot mutate." It never widens the privacy
 * policy: the read owner was constructed with the composition's `permittedPrivacy` and subject, and the
 * read owner refuses a widened subject or an unpermitted class before this module sees anything. And it
 * injects ONCE per distinct head per session — a record already in the context is not re-appended every
 * turn.

 * recall reported `capacity=27` — twenty-seven candidates that had CLEARED the threshold and were
 * then discarded for room. The COUNT was the whole constraint and the characters were not: three
 * median notes spend about 483 of this section's 1,200 characters, so the budget sat roughly 60%
 * empty while twenty-seven matching notes were thrown away. With 320 notes in the store and three
 * slots, most of the memory never reached any session at all.
 *
 * SIX, NOT MORE, AND THE CHARACTER BUDGET IS WHY. This cap and `MAX_RECALLED_CHARS` both apply —
 * the renderer takes `min(sectionBudget, …)` and walks the list — so the pair fails safe. Six median
 * notes cost about 966 characters and fit inside 1,200; six notes at the measured MEAN of 612 would
 * cost about 3,672 and are stopped by the character budget long before the count is reached. Raising
 * the count therefore gains memory exactly when notes are small, and can never overrun the section
 * when they are large. Do not move one of the two without measuring the other.

/**
 * WHAT A RECORD SAYS ABOUT ITSELF, IN WORDS A PERSON READS.
 *
 * The read path already computes all of this — every snippet carries where it came from, whether
 * anything supersedes it, whether anything contradicts it, how many revisions its line has been
 * through, and any `conditions`/`ceiling` the record declares about itself. The surface printed the
 * record's prose and a parenthesised trailer of FIELD NAMES instead, which asks a reader to know what
 * `auraSequence` and `verifiedHead` mean before they can tell whether the memory in front of them has
 * been overtaken. A warning you must already understand the schema to see is not a warning.
 *
 * THREE RULES THIS OBEYS, each of them a way the surface could lie:
 *   - IT NEVER INVENTS A POSITION. `revision` is null when the succession could not be walked (a cycle,
 *     or a chain longer than the retrieval bound), and null renders as "not established" — never as an
 *     implied 1, which a reader would take for "the original and still current".
 *   - IT NEVER LETS SILENCE MEAN CURRENT. Only `current === true` earns the sentence that nothing
 *     supersedes the record; a snippet that does not carry the field gets "not established" instead,
 *     because an absent field and a false one must not read the same where a person acts on the answer.
 *   - IT KEEPS THE VALUES. "In plain words" is not "vaguer": the record id, the ledger position and the
 *     head all stay, so a reader can still check the claim against the evidence.
 * @param {Record<string, unknown>} snippet one snippet as the read path builds it.

 * "no visible record" while a record sat in the store. `kira_recall` answers `availability: 'found'`
 * with `status: 'insufficient'` and NO snippets when the store holds records but the QUERY matched none.
 * Rendering that as an empty store tells a fresh session it has no history when it has some.
 *
 *   `empty`                     the store holds nothing. A real answer.
 *   `undetermined`              the store could not be verified. A DEFECT, and absence is not evidence.
 *   `found` + `insufficient`    the store HOLDS RECORDS; this question matched none. The query's fault,
 *                              not the store's — and that distinction is exactly what should make a
 *                              model retry with different words instead of concluding it has no past.
 *
 * NO FILE PATH APPEARS IN THIS COMMENT, deliberately — the recall court enforces a write boundary over
 * this plugin's sources with a SUBSTRING rule matching the test-adapter module name and the test
 * directory prefix, judged on substrings rather than imports. Writing either here turns that court RED,
 * exactly as it did when this line first named the court's own file. Name the court by its subject.
