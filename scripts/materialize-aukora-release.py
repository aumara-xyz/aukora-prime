"""Materialize a self-contained AUKORA release from the built candidate tree.

A release is a copy of the built application plus the authored plugin *inside
it*, a composition patch that reaches that copy through a release-relative
path, and an artifact record produced against the copy. Everything a launch
loads is therefore inside the directory the checker verifies — no composition
row may point back at the mutable worktree.

The copy is then *stripped*: upstream's own notes, documentation, translation
twins, per-package sources and tests, build tooling and Python SDK are removed
from the release so that what remains is what runs. The strip rules live in
scripts/artifacts-coverage.json; scripts/release-strip.mjs applies them, writes
<release>/strip-manifest.json (every deleted path with its byte count and
digest, the keep rules applied, and the tree totals before and after), and the
artifact record produced afterwards attests that manifest by digest. The strip
runs before the record on purpose: the record must describe the tree that will
be launched, not the tree it was copied from.

OFFERED_MINDS = ('balanced', 'deep', 'quick', 'muse', 'opus')

#: THE LIVE STATE ROOT, DERIVED ONCE. Two readers need it — the retention policy looks for a launch and a
#: rollback record here, and the face config's `organismDshHome` must point at the DSH home the LANES
#: actually use. A second hand-typed path is how the two came apart: the emitted value was the app-support
#: root while the organism lens joins `dshHome + 'storages/session_projcache/sessions'` and

# in scripts/artifacts-coverage.json because `scripts/**` is a strip pattern and the
# runtime-reference scan cannot reach a path no built runtime names.
#
# THE CLOSURE IS NOT THIS ONE DIRECTORY. Traced by following imports, not by reading prose:
# `scripts/aura/adapter.py` puts `scripts/composition` AND `scripts/phase0` on sys.path and then
# imports `aura`, `receipt` and `phase0log` by bare name. So `scripts/phase0/phase0log.py` is a
# hard dependency, and a release carrying only scripts/composition cannot even import its own
# adapter. Both the adapter and the composition CLI also execute
# `vendor/append-only/verify.py`, and the accepted receipt contract lives in
# `vendor/receipt/toy`. Those two vendored trees are carried whole: `scripts/phase0-check-pins.py`
# pins every file under each named tree and refuses a tree whose pins and bytes disagree, so a
# subset would be a tree the repository's own pin check no longer describes.

#: deliberately NOT carried while it was outside the receipt closure, and MEASURED 2026-09-21 that
#: decision has expired: without it the shipped retainer answers `RETAINER_UNREACHED` with
#: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'retainer'` while every checkout-driven arm stays green, so
#: the gap is visible only from a release. `tests/aura-settle-retain.test.mjs` arm 4 is that

PHASE0_RETAINER = ROOT / 'scripts/phase0/retainer.py'

#: its settle path (`retain_memory_head`, called by `inscribe`), so inside a release this file is the
#: one a settle runs. The capability is memory-ledger retention: a head of Kira's memory ledger is
#: kept OUTSIDE its state dir, so a dropped newest memory is visible instead of silently absent.
#: `strip.patterns` is `scripts/**`, which deletes it exactly as it would have deleted `retainer.py`,
#: and a release that is missing it does not crash and does not stay silent: the degrade is the NAMED
#: status `MEMORY_HEAD_UNAVAILABLE`, raised as `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'memory_head'`.
#: Same shape as the retainer's own measured failure (`RETAINER_UNREACHED`), and invisible from the
#: checkout for the same reason — every checkout-driven arm stays green because the checkout always

# Diamond's cold Kira evidence consumer. Carried so ONE RELEASE can verify its own exported
# evidence with no sibling repository: the verifier resolves `diamond` from `--package-root`
# naming this directory, so the bytes it runs are the bytes the release attests. It is a
# SEPARATE PROCESS on an operator's command, never on the request path, and it confers no
# authority: cold verification answers "do these Kira bytes and signatures agree under the keys
# I supplied", never "is this write authorized" and never "did the cell run" (it always reports
# `cellRan: null`). `upstream-diamond.json` pins every file, and `phase0-check-pins.py` holds
# the same closure to the same digests on both sides of the copy.
# `vendor/seed` is aukora-seed's path guard at 9fca7a0, byte for byte (PROVENANCE.json pins every file). The
# action gate (plugins/aukora-action-gate) calls its `analyse`, `judge` and `decide` on every agent tool call, so the
# release must carry it or the gate cannot import its judge.
# `aukora-packages` and `vendor/authority` carry the original memory law (aumara-xyz/aukora packages/memory and
# packages/kernel at def297f). Kira's `plugins/aukora-kira/lib/memory-law.mjs` imports the generated
# `vendor/aukora-packages/lib/packages/memory/src/{envelope,ingestGate}.js`, which import
# `vendor/authority/lib/canonical.js` and its pinned `deps/@noble/hashes@2.2.0`, so a release without these two
# trees could not load Kira at all (the ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND class LANE_PLUGINS below records).
# `aukora-first-echo` is imported by `scripts/aura/echo-head.mjs` (carried: `scripts/aura/**`), so a release without it

# authored source, both are ignored by git, and a release exists to attest the source it carries* -- *so
# shipping them inflates the stripped totals, puts unmeasured bytes into a tree whose digests are the whole
# point, and can carry a voice model off the machine.* **The audit offered two fixes; this is the second,
# and it is the one that ALSO reaches the face build** (*see `build-face.py`, which CLONES rather than copies
# and therefore needed a filter of its own*).
#
# **THE PATTERNS ARE `shutil.ignore_patterns` GLOBS, NOT REGEXES.** *A `.venv` is a virtualenv: a build
# artefact that can be gigabytes and is regenerated from `requirements`, never authored.* *The audio
# extensions are listed separately from the directory, because a stray `.wav` OUTSIDE `voice/models` is the
# same egress.*
#
# *** THE FOUR CASES WERE "PROBED RATHER THAN ASSUMED", AND THIS SENTENCE SAID `voice/models` MATCHES. IT DOES
# NOT, AND THAT CLAIM IS WHY THE INERT PATTERN SURVIVED REVIEW (corrected, aura-83 R532). ***
# *A probe against `ignore_patterns` cannot be run by testing a pattern against itself:*
#     fnmatch('voice/models', 'voice/models')  ->  TRUE    ← a probe against itself; asks nothing
#     fnmatch('models',       'voice/models')  ->  FALSE   ← WHAT `ignore_patterns` ACTUALLY ASKS
# *`ignore_patterns` never compares the pattern to the pattern; it compares it to each entry's BASENAME, and a
# basename never contains `/`.* **So the four cases, as they actually behave:**
#     `a.wav`         MATCHES    (a basename glob -- the correct form, and the audio list below relies on it)
#     `models` alone  MATCHES    (and would over-match every `models` directory: the reason it is not used)
#     `voice/models`  DOES NOT MATCH, and never did, until it was handled BY POSITION in `COPY_IGNORE` below
#     `README.md`     does not match, correctly
# *** A PROBE THAT TESTS A VALUE AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT FAIL, WHICH IS THE ONE PROPERTY A PROBE MUST HAVE. ***

#   covered, the egress audit read it as covered, and the model file was copied into every build and release.**
# *So `'voice/models'` is composed OUT of the pattern set here and handled by position instead* -- `**/voice/models`

# loads from the release root with no store resolution. NO `strip.keep` ENTRY ACCOMPANIES IT: no

    * `fs-sandbox` declares `inject = ['tools', 'fs', 'systemPrompt']`, and a preset mount resolves
      injection BEFORE ANY SESSION EXISTS (`plugins/aukora-core-read-deny/README.md`, quoting
      `presets/core/agent.cordis.yml`: "The `fs` service and its policy stay in the host"). So the swap is
      one host row that REPLACES the sandbox provider: `ctx.provide` throws on a second registration of a
      name, which is why the guard wraps the provider it is given instead of providing `fs` beside it.
      PRESET SCOPING IS THE PLUGIN'S OWN DECISION, not the row's: the guard is handed `presetOf`, refuses
      a core initiator and leaves every other reader exactly as it was — so a STANDARD agent is unchanged
      while a CORE agent is refused.
    * the `subagents` registry is a host-plane process singleton and a provider name may only be
      registered once, so mounting the two hand providers in a preset would collide as soon as a second
      session mounted CORE (`plugins/aukora-subscription-hands/CONFIG.md` §2).

    The row that mounts a plugin the release does not carry is the caaf outage, so `LANE_PLUGINS` carries
    both directories and `tests/aukora-core-mounts.test.mjs` measures the composed result rather than this
    function's intent.

    # retain. Measured, on the retainer's own precedent rather than by analogy: the failure is a
    # NAMED status (`MEMORY_HEAD_UNAVAILABLE` over `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
    # 'memory_head'`) and every checkout-driven arm stays green, because the checkout always has the

    # THE LANE PATCH, carried in the release but NOT mounted by its own composition. Same rule as
    # the governed demo above: written BEFORE the strip and the record, because a file added to the
    # release afterwards is a release the record does not describe — measured, the launcher refuses
    # it with release-verification-failed, which is the artifact record doing its job.
    #
    # Mounting is not provisioning. The aukora-kira row names a memoryOwner the plugin constructs
    # itself over a STATE-ROOT-RELATIVE directory (so a disposable preview writes disposable state);
    # the aukora-aumlok row mounts the lane so it is reachable and still fail-closed, since a
    # promotion without provisioned primitives refuses by name.
    # ROW NAMES ARE ABSOLUTE INTO THE RELEASE. Measured 2026-09-17 on two launches: a
    # relative `./plugins/...` in a --patch overlay resolves against the working directory the
    # loader was given, not the release, and the row then fails to activate WITHOUT ANY
    # DIAGNOSTIC. Kira's overlay that did mount used the absolute form. The per-deployment
    # values (Kira's state directory and the operator documents) are `!!js dshHomePath(...)`
    # expressions, the same idiom the base bundle uses for its own storage, so the release
    # carries a template and the state root stays the launcher's input.
    #
    # BOTH OPERATOR DOCUMENTS ARE NAMED, AND THE ROW IS REFUSED AT MOUNT WITHOUT THE SECOND.
    # Kira's `readConfig` requires `memoryOwner.approvalFile` beside `grantFile` and refuses with
    # `kira.config:memory-owner-approval-unconfigured` when it is absent, so a release generated
    # without this line mounts no Kira row at all. The reason is the grant's provenance: a grant
    # is minted by whatever runs the grant command, including the turn that wants the write,
    # whereas an approval is the owner's signed act over the exact content. A composition that
    # named only `grantFile` therefore offered a write tool nothing had authorized.
    # ONE FILE, TWO FIELDS: `scripts/kira/kira-approve.mjs` writes
    # `{ authorization: { grant, record, subject }, approval: <bundle> }` to a single operator
    # document. The settlement path reads `authorization` through `grantFile` and `approval`
    # through `approvalFile`, so pointing both at `kira-memory/grant.json` is the shape the
    # producer writes, not a coincidence of naming. Minting it is an OPERATOR act outside the
    # release: this file names the document and never creates it, and an unminted document
    # leaves the row mounted and fail-closed rather than silently writable.
    #
    # WHAT THIS ROW DOES NOT PIN, written here because this is the natural place to look for it.
    # The plugin also accepts an optional `memoryOwner.approverDid`, and naming it is what makes an
    # approval signed by any OTHER key refused by name. This row names none, so no approver key is
    # pinned and the plugin's `APPROVER_PINNED` is ABSENT rather than satisfied — an unset pin,
    # visibly, not a pin that holds. That is a DECISION, not an oversight: the value is
    # deployment-specific and there is no registered controller to point at, so any value written
    # here would be invented, and an invented pin is worse than an absent one because it looks like
    # enforcement while enforcing nothing. Pinning it is an owner/deployment act, performed for the
    # deployment that has a registered key (a `--patch` overlay naming `approverDid`), never by
    # baking one value into every release this file generates.
    #
    # THE SUBJECT IS NOT THIS FILE'S TO CHOOSE, AND THIS IS A STOP RATHER THAN A FIX. Both rows
    # below name `subject: aumlok:subject:owner`, and MEASURED 2026-09-20 that value is refused by
    # the approval path's own reader: `scripts/kira/kira-approve.mjs --subject aumlok:subject:owner`
    # exits 1 with `owner approval request.subject: must use the aukora:1:<sha256> form` (Aumlok's
    # `readAukoraId`; the grammar is `/^aukora:1:[0-9a-f]{64}$/`). The GRANT for the same subject
    # still mints — `plugins/aukora-kira/bin/kira-grant.mjs --subject <anything>` is deliberately
    # subject-agnostic — so the wire does not fail at mount or at grant. It dead-ends ONE STEP
    # LATER, at the approval: a record can be staged under `aumlok:subject:owner` and no approval
    # for it can ever be produced, so the write is unmintable and the memory path is unusable
    # while every check above stays green. That is the defect this comment records.
    #
    # WHY THE VALUE CANNOT BE WRITTEN HERE. The subject a deployment serves is DERIVED, not stored:
    # `aukoraIdFromGenesis` hashes the immutable genesis record (domain-separated sha256 over
    # `{domain, genesisNonce, initialRootKeySetId, amendmentRuleDigest}`) that the deployment's
    # controller created from 32 bytes of CSPRNG entropy at provisioning. MEASURED: two disposable
    # controllers built with different seeds serve two different subjects
    # (`aukora:1:c03c47…` and `aukora:1:a16b09…`), and the only shipped command that serves one is
    # `node scripts/aumlok/project.mjs <controller-directory>`, which PRINTS `SUBJECT: aukora:1:<hex>`.
    # This file materializes ONE release for MANY deployments — the same reason `stateDir` is a
    # `!!js dshHomePath(...)` template rather than a baked path — so it has nowhere to read that
    # value at materialization time, and a literal written here would be an INVENTED identity: the
    # same class of error as an invented approver pin, and worse than an obvious gap because a
    # grammatical `aukora:1:<64 hex>` looks exactly like a real one. Two mechanisms were considered
    # and rejected: a `--kira-subject` input at materialization time (one artifact, many
    # deployments, and it would make every existing caller fail), and reading the value out of the
    # operator's approval bundle at launch (circular — the bundle only exists after an approval —
    # and it would compare the record's subject against the artifact's own, making the approval
    # lane's `RECORD_SUBJECT_MISMATCH` refusal unfalsifiable).
    #
    # WHAT THE OPERATOR MUST DO INSTEAD, and why the overlay has to restate every field: name the
    # deployment's own subject in a `--patch` overlay applied after this row. A patch that assigns
    # `config` REPLACES the `memoryOwner` object rather than merging into it — this file records
    # the same trap for `council-claude` below — so an overlay carrying only `subject` silently
    # drops `stateDir`, `approvalFile` and `grantFile` with it. The overlay must restate all five.
    # KEPT FOR THE PATCH-HEADER COMMENTS AND ANY DIAGNOSTIC THAT NAMES THE RELEASE; THE ROW NAMES THEMSELVES ARE
    # RELEASE-RELATIVE NOW. MEASURED WHY: five rows here and four in the lanes patch used to carry
    # `name: <absolute path>`, and `scripts/aura/release-closure.mjs` reads exactly the `name: ./path` shape
    # ("A DELIBERATELY NARROW READ"), so **every absolutely-named row was invisible to the closure walk** —
    # `aukora-board` among them. That is how a release whose board cannot import at all still reported
    # `CLOSED — every specifier resolves inside the release` while the live app failed to load it. A relative
    # name also satisfies the launcher's own `patch-not-release-local` rule by construction.
    release_root = str(target.resolve())
    # THE ORGANS GO IN THE DEFAULT COMPOSITION, not in an overlay nobody passes.
    #
    # Measured: with the organs in a separate overlay, launching the default composition gives
    # organism-accept 4/7 — the receipt path passes and every organ FAILS as not-mounted. A restart
    # that loads only `aukora-composition.patch.yml` therefore produces a live app whose lanes are
    # still absent, which is the exact "prepared but not live" the accept command exists to catch.

    # ── aura-81 (3): THE CUT FAILS WHEN THE COMPOSED KIRA SUBJECT IS NOT `aukora:1:<64hex>` ──────────
    #
    # **THIS IS A STOP-THE-LINE, AND IT IS DELIBERATELY PLACED BEFORE THE RELEASE IS CALLED COMPLETE.**
    # *The composed patch names `subject: aumlok:subject:owner`* — and **the preflight reports that the
    # memory subject must be `aukora:1:<64hex>`.** *KIRA is establishing which side is right; until that is
    # settled, a release that ships the wrong subject is a release whose memory writes land under a subject
    # nothing reads.*
    #
    # **WHY FAIL HERE RATHER THAN WARN.** *A subject that is wrong produces a release that BOOTS, serves,
    # passes its closure court, and silently stores nothing recallable* — **the failure appears much later, in
    # a session where recall returns nothing, and is diagnosed as a memory bug rather than as a composition
    # value.** *A cut is the last moment the value is still cheap to fix*, so it is the moment to refuse.
    #
    # **AND THE REFUSAL NAMES BOTH VALUES**, because the two sides disagree and the reader needs to see the
    # disagreement rather than only the expectation: *the shape demanded, and the shape found.*
    # ── aura-82: THE CUT ACCEPTS THE DOCUMENTED PLACEHOLDER. **THE REFUSAL WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE.** ──
    #
    # **WHAT I GOT WRONG IN aura-81, AND FABLE MEASURED IT**: I put the canonical-subject refusal HERE, so
    # every cut failed. **But a release CARRIES the placeholder BY DESIGN** — *this file's own comment at
    # :1095 says the subject "is not this file's to choose" and that "pinning it is an owner/deployment act,
    # performed for the deployment that has a registered key (a `--patch` overlay naming `approverDid`)"* —
    # **and the DEPLOYMENT overlay supplies the real one.** *The release is the artefact; the overlay is the
    # installation.* **Refusing in the materializer refused the ARTEFACT for a property of the INSTALLATION.**
    #
    # **AND THE PLACE IT BELONGS IS WHERE THE TWO ARE COMPOSED**: `desktop-cutover prepare` and
    # `desktop-parity-boot`, which apply every patch in the SUPPORT CONFIG and can therefore evaluate the
    # EFFECTIVE subject. *That is the first moment the real value exists* — and it is the moment a wrong one
    # would reach a live desktop, which is what the refusal is for.
    #
    # **SO THIS IS NOW A NAMED NOTE AND NOT A REFUSAL.** *A cut that prints nothing at all here would let the
    # placeholder ship silently*; **a cut that refuses cannot produce the artefacts the overlay is applied
    # to.** *The note says which case it is, so a reader of the cut log knows whether the deployment overlay
    # is still needed.*

    # the row MOUNTS with an admitted producer and carries the review queue, but two values in that
    # row are not this file's to choose and are both measured stops rather than oversights:
    #
    #   * the SUBJECT is derived, never typed. `node scripts/aumlok/project.mjs <controller-directory>`
    #     is the only shipped command that serves one, and a literal written here would be an
    #     INVENTED identity — a grammatical `aukora:1:<64 hex>` looks exactly like a real one.
    #     MEASURED 2026-09-21 against the running desktop app (release a1c9189, pid 4937): the value
    #     this composition carries (`aumlok:subject:owner`) is REFUSED OUTRIGHT by the approval
    #     path's own reader —
    #       `node scripts/kira/kira-approve.mjs --subject aumlok:subject:owner …`
    #       → `REFUSE: owner approval request.subject: must use the aukora:1:<sha256> form`, exit 1,
    #     while the same command with a grammatical subject exits 0 and writes the artifact. So no
    #     approval for that subject can ever be produced and the write is unmintable. This was found
    #     independently here and in the integration lane; both measurements agree.
    #   * the APPROVER PIN is deployment-specific for the same reason: `approverDid` is the DID
    #     derived from the controller's own registered approval key, and pinning an invented one is
    #     worse than pinning none because it looks like enforcement while enforcing nothing.
    #
    # So the template travels WITH the release (attested, so its bytes are tamper-evident) and is
    # filled in by the operator for the deployment being served. It restates EVERY memoryOwner field
    # the composition names because a `config` assignment REPLACES the object rather than merging
    # into it: an overlay carrying only `subject` silently drops `stateDir`, `grantFile` and
    # `approvalFile` with it. That is also why `queueDir` is restated here rather than only in the
    # composition: this overlay is the LAST word on the row for a deployment that passes it, so a
    # key left out of it is a key the deployment does not serve — the queue would be configured in
    # the release and absent at the restart. It carries NO `name:` key on purpose — the loader skips

    # THE SESSION-QUERY OVERRIDE IS NOT EMITTED YET, AND HERE IS THE MEASURED REASON.
    #
    # `packages/bundle/base/cordis.patch.yml` mounts `session-query-sqlite` with
    # `path: ':memory:'`, `openAt: never`, and says in its own comment that a deployment enabling
    # content search overrides both in a later patch layer or a `--patch` overlay, "typically with a
    # durable `path`". The override is therefore the documented mechanism.
    #
    # What blocks it is WHERE the value comes from. A durable path must live under the state home,
    # and the state home is the LAUNCHER's input, not the release's: the same release is launched
    # against different state roots. `launch-dsh.py:96` refuses `patch-not-release-local` for any
    # overlay outside the verified release, so a patch naming one machine's state path cannot be
    # passed in, and a patch baked with a concrete path at materialization time would be wrong on
    # every other machine — and would be inside the record, so it could not be corrected later.
    #
