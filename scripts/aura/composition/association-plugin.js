/**
 * AUKORA Aura association — the observation adapter's association verb, mounted in the
 * composition as one read-only tool.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MOUNTS. `scripts/aura/adapter.py associate` answers one question: do these two
 * documents describe this log? It prints the pinned court's verdict, the composition's own
 * verdict over the same prefixes, and either an association or a named refusal. This plugin puts
 * that answer inside the running composition, so the app can ask it without an operator shelling
 * out — and so the answer arrives with the ceilings attached instead of as a bare verdict.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not an authority: the tool carries no grant, no nonce, no key and no
 * receipt, it writes nothing, and it cannot retain, publish or settle anything. It runs one
 * subprocess and returns what that subprocess said. The verdict is the vendored court's over the
 * bytes on disk; `evidence, not truth` and `evidence, not authorization` are returned with it.
 *
 * CONFIGURATION, AND WHY THE ROW CAN BE SHORT. `gateRoot` defaults to the release root this file
 * is installed in (three levels up from `plugins/<id>/lib/index.js`), so a row that names a
 * release-relative `name:` needs to say nothing else. `stateDir` is resolved in this order:
 * the row's `stateDir`, then `stateDir` inside the JSON named by `AUKORA_GATE_CONFIG` — the file
 * the launcher already writes for the gate — and last `<gateRoot>/gate-state`. One source of
 * truth for where the log lives, instead of a second copy that can disagree with it.
 *
 * The tool is pinned to that state directory. `allowOtherStates: true` in the row is the explicit
 * opt-in for naming another, because a tool the model can point at any path is a tool that reads
 * whatever it is told to; the default refuses by name.
 *
