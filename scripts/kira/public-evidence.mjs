/**
 * PUBLIC EVIDENCE — one durable, allowlisted handoff directory for an INDEPENDENT consumer.
 *
 *   node scripts/kira/public-evidence.mjs export \
 *     --store <stateDir> --out <dir> --producer-commit <40 hex> --release <abs release dir> \
 *     --anchor issuer=<file> [--anchor <name>=<file>]... \
 *     [--approval <contentSha256>=<flat aukora:approval-receipt:v1 file>]...
 *
 *   node scripts/kira/public-evidence.mjs verify --export <dir> [--json]
 *
 * Invariant: every digest carries its producer commit, relative member path and byte count.
 * Threat: a bare digest or path-dependent record can be mistaken for portable proof.
 * Reason: the consumer needs the exact object and provenance to repeat the measurement.
 * Historical rationale: plan/ADR-EVIDENCE-HANDOFF.md.
 *
 * WHAT A HANDOFF DIRECTORY IS. A fixed layout an independent consumer can be pointed at:
 *
 *   <out>/manifest.json                          the handoff itself: every file, its digest and size
 *   <out>/producer-commit.txt                    the Genesis commit that produced the evidence
 *   <out>/release-record.json                    the release path, record path and record digest
 *   <out>/release-record/genesis-artifacts.json  the record BYTES the digest is about
 *   <out>/evidence/aura.jsonl                    the Aura log (Diamond: --log)
 *   <out>/evidence/objects/<sha256>.json         exact content bytes {key,value}+"\n" (--artifact-content)
 *   <out>/evidence/records/<sha256>.json         the record as its own document (--record)
 *   <out>/evidence/receipts/<sha256>.json        the producer's receipt (--receipt)
 *   <out>/evidence/approvals/<sha256>.json       the flat approval artifact (--artifact)
 *   <out>/anchors/<name>.<ext>                   PUBLIC anchors, supplied from OUTSIDE the store
 *
 * THE MANIFEST CARRIES THE RECORD BYTES, NOT ONLY ITS DIGEST. A digest naming an artifact the
 * receiver does not hold is exactly the failure this directory exists to end, so the release record
 * travels inside the export and `verify` re-hashes it offline against the digest in the manifest.
 *
 * ALLOWLIST ONLY, DEFAULT-DENY, NAMED ON EVERY REFUSAL. A whole-store copy is not an export.
 * `plugins/aukora-kira/lib/memory-owner.mjs:194-200` stores the issuer PRIVATE KEY — a PKCS#8 PEM —
 * in `<stateDir>/issuer.json` beside the public half, and a reviewer's reproduction of a whole-store
 * copy leaked a synthetic canary through exactly that shape. Three store members are evidence and are
 * copied; every other member is left behind and NAMED in `manifest.excluded[]` with the reason it
 * stayed. There is no `--include-all`, no glob, and no wildcard directory copy anywhere in this file:
 *
 *   aura.jsonl                        the Aura chain
 *   objects/<64 lower hex>.json       content-addressed object bodies
 *   receipt-memory.put-<digits>.json  the producer's receipts
 *
 * The private members are refused BY NAME rather than merely dropped, so a caller that asks for one
 * is told which member it asked for and why it is not evidence:
 *
 *   issuer.json    the owner's own key pair, private half included  (memory-owner.mjs:194-200)
 *   grant.json     a one-use operator grant document
 *   approval.json  a one-use operator approval document
 *   seq            the store's private sequence counter
 *   spent/**       the one-use nonce registry
 *   approvals/**   the approval consumption registry, which names which operations were approved
 *
 * EVERY BYTE THAT IS COPIED IS RE-CHECKED, NOT TRUSTED. A symlink anywhere in the store or in an
 * export is refused by name; every JSON document written is checked against a CLOSED field set taken
 * from the producer's own contract; and every document is scanned for private-key material by field
 * name and by PEM header, at any depth, because a record's `content` is caller-supplied and is the
 * one place a key could ride out inside an otherwise clean export.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. Two runs over identical inputs produce byte-identical output, which is a property
 * `tests/public-evidence.test.mjs` measures rather than asserts. That is why the manifest carries NO
 * CLOCK and no host name: a `generatedAt` field would make every run disagree with every other and
 * would put a value in the handoff that no consumer can check. The temporal anchor is the producer
 * commit, and the spatial anchor is the release path.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not verify the evidence — that is Diamond's job, and a producer that
 * also judged its own bytes would be agreeing with itself. It does not authorize anything, does not
 * mount a plugin, does not touch a running process, and reads no state directory but the one it is
 * given. It computes no signature and holds no key. `evidence/approvals/*` is a COPY of an artifact
 * another lane's signer produced; this file never mints one.
